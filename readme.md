This is a web application launched with nodemon. Users submit compliments to a mongodb database. A random entry is pulled from the database and displayed when the user visits the main page. Only the admin can edit/update and delete compliments, and see an index of all compliments in the database.

The code follows the standard MVC architecture, and CRUDS a single resource: compliments.

v3.0 features that have NOT been implemented:

NEW RESOURCE: "User"

Users assign hashtags to compliments. The hashtags are associated with both the compliment they are assigned to and the user profile that assigns them. After assigning a hashtag to a compliment, the user is then able to see compliments with this hashtag.

User profiles consisting of hashtag associations curate the experience, determining which compliments appear on the usersâ€™ homepage. This encourages content creation: In order to see the desired compliments, the user must submit their own original compliment with the desired hashtag.
